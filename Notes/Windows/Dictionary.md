**Globally unique identifier (GUID)** - Similar to how books have ISBNs and vehicles having VINs. Microsoft's GUID is a 128-bit string value that consists of one group of 8 hex digits, followed by three groups of 4 hex digits each, followed by one group of 12 hex digits that represents an identification (ID). 
- Organizations generate GUIDs when a unique reference number is needed to identify information on a computer or network. A GUID can be used to ID hardware, software, accounts, documents and other items. 
- Can be interchangeable with the [RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122) universal unique identifier (UUID)
- Example:
	- GUID: 6B29FC40-CA47-1067-B31D-00DD010662DA
